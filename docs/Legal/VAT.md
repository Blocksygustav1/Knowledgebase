# Why Am I being charged VAT?
We have to charge VAT to customers based in the UK by law, this rate is set at 20%. If you are a customer outside of the UK, no VAT or sales tax is added to your cart. Your tax status is determined by the country selected by the user on the [billing portal](https://client.enviromc.host).

If you are being given a price with VAT at checkout and you aren't registered in the UK, your IP may be registered to a UK entity. Once you complete checkout and enter your address, that tax will be removed. If you are/aren't being charged VAT as expected, please reach out to us and we can assist further.
