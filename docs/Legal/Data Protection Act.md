# Data privacy, security and where data is hosted 
We are a UK based limited company and therefore obliged to disclose certain information and abide by certain data regulations. As we hold personal information such as IPs, emails, names, etc of customers, we are obliged to be registered to the information commissioner's office ([ICO](https://ico.org.uk/)) and follow the UK data protection act* ([DPA](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection) - You can read your rights here).

What does this mean for you? 
- You have the legal right to request your data be removed at any point. We can raise exception to this in limited circumstances (eg, we may retain information such as IPs, alias', emails, among other information for fraudulent accounts to allow us to recognise them in the future). 
- You are able to download all data held about you at any point in time, free of charge
- We don't collect standard user data around protected charecteristics such as Gender, race or ethnicity, religion, sexuality or orientation - not that it's our bussiness. We welcome everyone in our community regardless.
- Any third parties that we would need to share information with are required to comply with the UK's DPA standards. This limits the countries and locations your sensitive data can be stored in and who your data can be shared with. We will share the minimum required amount of data for any use case (An example being, your email and select billing credentials are shared with our card provider [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as this is required to process payments and decrease potential fraudulent activity)
